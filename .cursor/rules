## Commit Message Format

When creating commit messages, always append "AI-generated: <percentage>" to indicate the percentage of code that was AI-generated.

Example commit messages:
- "feat: Add new feature AI-generated: 80%"
- "fix: Resolve issue AI-generated: 30%"
- "docs: Update documentation AI-generated: 100%"

The percentage should reflect the approximate amount of code/content that was generated or significantly modified by AI assistance.
